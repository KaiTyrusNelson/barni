Installation
============
Prior to installation you will need Python3.6+ with additional packages. `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io.downloads/>`_ is the recommended platform to install all the packages you need. 

To instally BARNI you simply need to run the :file:`setup.py` script: 

.. code:: bash

  python setup.py install --user

The "--user" option installs the package locally, which bipasses the need to be a computer administrator.

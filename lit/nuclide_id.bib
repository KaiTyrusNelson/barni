  abstract  = {Gamma spectrum analysis is a standard tool in many fields today. Often
	the task is to find out the exact composition and concentrations
	of radionuclides in a measured spectrum. A full manual identification
	of a complex spectrum requires considerable expertise on the part
	of the laboratory personnel and takes usually several hours.
	
	An expert system coupled with the gamma spectrum analysis system SAMPO
	has been developed for automating the qualitative identification
	of radionuclides as well as for determinating the quantitative parameters
	of the spectrum components. The program is written in C-language
	and runs in various environments ranging from PCs to UNIX workstations.
	The expert system utilizes a complete gamma library with over 2600
	nuclides and 80 000 lines, and a rule base of about fifty criteria
	including energies, relative peak intensities, genesis modes, half-lives,
	parent-daughter relationships etc. The rule base is furthermore extensible
	by the user.
	
	The performance of the expert system has been evaluated using test
	cases from environmental samples, sets of standard sources and activation
	analysis measurements, which have been carefully analyzed manually.
	Also. synthesized spectra have been used, where the exact composition
	of the sample is known in advance. Results from these tests show
	that the expert system performs very well, even for difficult spectra.},

  abstract  = {Radionuclide identification from a measured gamma-spectrum
	is an iterative process, where the analyst aims to find correct nuclides
	by decreasing the amount of possibilities by trial and error. Although
	the process of identification is quite complex, it can be formulated
	using rules of thumb combined with exact mathematical analysis. Thus,
	an expert system can be built, where the knowledge of a human expert
	is converted to explicit rules. In this paper expert system SHAMAN
	is presented, which carriess out the qualitative nuclide identification
	and activity determination with minimum of user intervention. The
	reasoning process is performed by an inference engine written in
	C-language. The system uses a database containing over 2000 radionuclides
	with about 48 000 gamma-transitions. Spectra are provided in preprocessed
	format, where peak energies, intensities and backgoounds with respective
	error estimates have been calculated by a separate analysis program.},
